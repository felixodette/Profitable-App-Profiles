    "## Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. The company builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and the job is to enable a team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening and Exploring the Data\n",
    "As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting data for over four million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of data instead. To avoid spending resources with collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see whether we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our purpose:\n",
    "1. A data set containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).\n",

One thing we could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where we could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, we could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app.\n",
