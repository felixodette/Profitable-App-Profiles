# Profitable-App-Profiles
## Finding mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets

Our aim is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. The company builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and the job is to enable a team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

At the company, they only build apps that are free to download and install, and the main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
